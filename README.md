## 📝 Project Summary

### ✅ Outcomes
- NetGuardAI successfully detects DDoS attacks in network traffic using a variety of machine learning algorithms.
- Naive Bayes achieved the **highest detection performance** with an F1-score of 0.71 and recall of 0.92.
- Random Forest offered a **balanced accuracy (0.74)** and valuable feature importance insights.
- Visual tools like bar charts, pie charts, and time-series plots improved the interpretability of results.
- The application’s **Flask-based interface** enables smooth interaction, dataset upload, and report exports.

### ⚠️ Limitations
- Some models (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression) failed to detect DDoS traffic effectively in the tested dataset.
- The system currently operates in a **batch mode**, not real-time.
- Large `.pkl` files generated during training can exceed GitHub's file size limit.
- No advanced anomaly handling techniques (e.g., deep learning) are integrated yet.

### 🔭 Future Scope
- Implement **real-time traffic monitoring** and live anomaly detection pipelines.
- Expand to **deep learning architectures** like LSTM or Autoencoders for better sequence modeling.
- Add **user authentication and logging** for secure and auditable use.
- Integrate with **cloud storage or databases** to handle large-scale datasets and persistent results.
- Include a **self-learning feedback loop** to adapt the model continuously based on user verification.
